            <h2>1. Competition Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this competition is to foster collaboration and innovation amongst privacy experts, researchers and practitioners, by rewarding teamwork and innovation. Participants, acting as malicious analysts, will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks to test privacy-enhancing technologies and protection mechanisms, using various techniques, in an interactive database setting. The competition is referred to as the "PET ARENA CTF COMPETITION" (the "Competition"). A panel of distinguished cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach, technical soundness, and real-world impact of the submitted attacks.</p>
            <p>The Competition is operated and promoted by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TikTok Technology Limited if you are resident in one of the countries that form the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, or</li>

            <h2>5. Competition Structure and Objectives</h2>
            <h3>5.1. Environment</h3>
            <p>The Competition will take place within a secure, interactive database environment provided by TikTok. Teams will be granted access to this environment for the duration of the Competition. Direct access to the underlying infrastructure is prohibited.</p>
            
            <h3>5.2. Tracks and Missions</h3>
            <p>The Competition contains a total of five (5) missions, each mission containing three (3) tracks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track A (The Open Field)</strong> contains no privacy protection mechanism, minimal restrictions, infinite queries, and no attack detection modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Track B (The Epsilon Track)</strong> contains conventional DP mechanisms (Gaussian, Exponential, etc), limited privacy budgets, and some attack detection modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Track C (Beyond Episilon)</strong> contains utility optimized noise mechanisms, limited privacy budgets, and certain attack detection modules. This will be a black-box track.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not all tracks will be available for all missions. All Teams start with mission 1 and can choose between three tracks. While we recommend teams to start with mission 1, Participants can complete the missions in whatever order they wish to do so. The final mission is comprised of an "open field" where participants can test explore innovative techniques that have not yet been outlined in previous tracks or missions. Each successfully completed track within a mission will grant the teams points that will rank them on the leaderboard.</p>
            
            <h3>5.3 Objective</h3>
            <p>The primary goal is to successfully compromise the privacy of the data protected by various mechanisms. Success is measured by the criteria outlined in Section 6.</p>
            
            <h3>5.4 Competition Timeline</h3>
            <p>The competition will follow the key dates and times outlined in Section 2. Participants are the sole responsible for applying and submitting within the timeline. Late applications and submissions will not be considered.</p>

            <h3>6.1. Judging Panel</h3>
            <p>A panel of three to seven independent experts will evaluate only submissions that have accrued at least fifty (50) points or passed at least 2 missions on any of the tracks. The judging panel's decision will be final and binding. No correspondence will be entered into regarding the judging process or results.</p>
            
            <h3>6.2. Scoring Matrix</h3>
            <p>The success rate is measured by the following comprehensive scoring matrix:</p>
